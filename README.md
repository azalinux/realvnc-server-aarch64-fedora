# realvnc-server-aarch64-fedora

******** Still Testing - BETA ******

RealVNC Server Version:    6.7.2.43081

This repository is for installing RealVNC Server ARM64 edition on Fedora 33+ Workstation or Server for your Raspberry Pi device. Has been tested using a Pi4 with 8gb RAM and on multiple desktop environments including XFCE, LXQT & Plasma.

INSTALLATION

To install, clone the git respository and use the included install script:

$ sudo dnf install git

$ git clone https://github.com/azalinux/realvnc-server-aarch64-fedora

$ ./install.sh

I may produce a RPM binary at some point in the future however at this stage a manual install script will suffice.
